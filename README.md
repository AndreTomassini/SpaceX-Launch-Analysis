# SpaceX Launch Analysis üöÄ  

Interactive dashboard and data analysis of SpaceX Falcon 9 launches, exploring **payload mass**, **booster versions**, and **launch outcomes** using Python, Dash, and Plotly.  

## üìä Project Overview  
- Analyzed launch success rates by site and booster version.  
- Explored correlation between payload mass and launch outcomes.  
- Built an interactive dashboard with **Dash** and **Plotly**.  
- Applied machine learning (Decision Tree) to predict landing outcomes.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Libraries  
- Python 3  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Dash & Plotly  
- Scikit-learn  

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
